                 <img src="baja3.jpg">
                 <h4 style="color:#fff;">The Baja SAE competition originated at the University of South Carolina in 1976, under the
                  direction of Dr. John F. Stevens. Since then, the Baja SAE Series has become a premier
                  engineering design series for university teams. Baja SAEINDIA is an intercollegiate engineering
                  design competition for undergraduate and graduate engineering students. The object of the
                  competition is to simulate real-world engineering design projects and their related challenges.
                  Each team competes to have its design accepted by a fictitious firm for the manufacturer. The
                  students must function as a team to design, engineer, build, test, promote and compete with a
                  vehicle within the limits of the rules. They must also generate financial support for their project
                  and manage their educational priorities.</h4>
                  <br>
                  <h4 style="color:#fff;">The vehicles used in Baja SAE racing are often similar in appearance to dune buggies. It has
                     Static events, consisting of Technical Inspection, Cost, Design Judging, and Sales Presentation.
                     It also has dynamic events that include: Acceleration, Hill Climb or Traction Event,
                     Maneuverability, Specialty Events (Rock Crawl, Mud Bog, and Suspension), and an endurance
                     race to finish the competition.</h4><br>
